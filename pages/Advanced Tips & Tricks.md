	- Supercharge your pages and blocks by adding [properties](https://docs.logseq.com/#/page/properties) like this: `property-name::value`.
	  id:: 6499faf4-36c5-44d2-ba2a-9e489b209292
	  collapsed:: true
	  
	  A page property is added to its first block, and a block property is any property added to the block.
	  
	  Property values can be a mix of almost any text, links, page links and tags. Values can also be separated by commas.

- # Working with Media Files
	- Logseq lets you embed, preview, and play back a variety of media — whether it's saved online or saved on your computer. You can [learn more about embedding media here]([[Working with Media Files: Embed Audio, Photos, Videos]]).
-
- # Customization
	- Journals can be turned off if you don't need them. To turn them off, click on the three horizontal dots `•••` at the top-right and go to `Settings > Features > Journals`. Make sure you've [created a page](((6494c06d-c398-4d79-acac-aa9e4c44ad12))) that can be set as the home page.
	  collapsed:: true
		- ![Turn off journals](https://i.imgur.com/w5jxEER.mp4)
	-
	- If you're using the daily journal pages, make sure you set the date format that you want. Changing it after you've started working on your graph is a pain since it can break page references.
	  collapsed:: true
	  
	  To change the format, click on the three horizontal dots `•••` at the top-right and go to the `Settings > Editor > Preferred date format` and select the one you want. Make sure to [re-index](((6494c06d-6088-4a17-9c59-cf7e21b615f0))).
